# DataNill - A Secret Data Crowdsourcing Platform On Nillion.

In the current times when AI models are entering the market they need more and more data that can be non-sensitive and sensitive, models that are used in the niche industries like health, financial and other sectors need critical and private data but current data collection system does not have any way to facilitate private data collection, storage, and usage. Participants are willing to submit the private data but are hesitant due to lack of trust and mechanism to collet and manage data in current data crowdsourcing platforms.

To solve the issue we have DataNill powered by Nillion, which enables private data crowdsourcing in secret way. Where users can store their private data secretly and only allow acces to the data to the users they want to share with in a trustless environment. Data is blind validated by data collectors using Nillion's blind computation. This ensures that no private falls in the wrong hands and used for unintended purpose.

## Operations And Payments

For Operations and Payments DataNill is using Edu-Chain which is a Layer-3 EVM compatible that has high tps and low gas fees, with this DataNill enables a transaprent payment system and operations on the platform so that a fair and open system is created.

## DataNill Is Both Private And Transparent At The Same Time.

## How To Use

## For Data Collectors

1. Create a Campaign ID with a private campaign seed (remember it) and connect to Nillion Connect.
2. Submit the required data for campaign creation like name, description, budget, number of tasks, etc.
3. Click on 'Create Campaign Button' then Metamask Wallet opens. Send the budget and sign transaction.
4. Your campaign is created is successfully.
5. Now data submitters will submit 'Data Store' details from Nillion where they stored.
6. You can run blind validation on the collected data to validate the data using parameters that you want in data.
7. Access the data that is validated and pay the data submitter.

## For Data Submitters

1. Copy Campaign ID from campaigns page that you want to submit data to.
2. Go to submit data page and connect to Nillion Client by creating a User ID.
3. Then submit the data and give a data-name to store.
4. Store the data and copy the 'Store ID' and 'Data Name'
5. Go back to campaigns page select the campaign you wanted to submit data to and click on submit entry button.
6. Provide the 'Store ID' and 'Data name' in for and submit by signing a transaction on MetaMask.
7. When the data collector accept the entry you will recieve the payment.









# Nillion Technical Documentation

# Nillion Operations and Blind Compute Demo

This is a demo of the JavaScript Nillion Client working with payments connected to nillion-devnet or the Nillion Testnet.

Notes

- This uses a proxy /nilchain-proxy set up in the webpack that targets the json rpc from your .env file
- A Nillion config is in the nillion.ts file. This config reads environment variables from your .env file, which can either point to Testnet or nillion-devnet values

## Run nillion-devnet

First, [install the Nillion SDK and nilup](https://docs.nillion.com/nillion-sdk-and-tools#installation) if you haven't

```
curl https://nilup.nilogy.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

Install the `latest` version of nillion-devnet to pull the latest updated versions SDK tools including the latest nillion-devnet, and optionally enable telemetry

```
nilup install latest
nilup use latest
nilup instrumentation enable --wallet <your-eth-wallet-address>
```

Run the devnet using any seed (the example uses "my-seed") so the cluster id, websockets, and other environment variables stay constant even when you restart nillion-devnet.

```shell
nillion-devnet --seed my-seed
```

You will see an output like this:

```
nillion-devnet --seed my-seed
‚ÑπÔ∏è cluster id is 222257f5-f3ce-4b80-bdbc-0a51f6050996

üåÑ environment file written to /Users/steph/Library/Application Support/nillion.nillion/nillion-devnet.env
```

Copy the path printed after "üåÑ environment file written to" and open the file

```
vim "/Users/steph/Library/Application Support/nillion.nillion/nillion-devnet.env"
```

This file has the nillion-devnet generated values for cluster id, websocket, json rpc, and private key. You'll need to put these in your local .env in one of the next steps so that your cra-nillion demo app connects to the nillion-devnet.

## Connect to the Nillion Testnet

To connect your blind app to the Nillion Testnet, replace .env values with the [Testnet Config](https://docs.nillion.com/network-configuration)

## Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion.git
cd cra-nillion
```

Copy the up the .env.example file to a new .env and set up these variables to match the nillion environment file

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Update your newly created .env with environment variables outout in your terminal by nillion-devnet

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_PATH=/nilchain-proxy

# replace with values from nillion-devnet or for Nillion Testnet

REACT_APP_NILLION_CLUSTER_ID=
REACT_APP_NILLION_BOOTNODE_WEBSOCKET=
REACT_APP_NILLION_NILCHAIN_JSON_RPC=
REACT_APP_NILLION_NILCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Install dependencies and start the demo project.

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
